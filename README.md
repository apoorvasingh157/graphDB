# graphDB
graphDB is primarily a database abstraction layer that behaves as a graph database and runs on top of MySQL database. This project was primarily built because of the inability to install binaries on a cheap or free web hosting service. And hence arises the inability to use already present graph databases in your project. So I wanted to come up with something that is very neat and can be used anywhere without requiring to install any binaries on the hosting platform.

What this library does is that it creates some tables in the MySQL database and stores all the graph data in those 3 tables. At present, it is designed to be used in a procedural manner but soon I'll try to code the object oriented part in it as well.

Head over to the wiki section to see the complete documentation.
